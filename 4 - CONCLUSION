CONCLUSIONS

- Unconditional bias, significant but lower than the general population.
- No inference: correlation remains too low, multiple results depending on selected variables, many fluctuations remain unexplained.
- This analysis demonstrates the complexity of the subject with so many variables impacting wages: gender, age, education, children,...
- The "Food Preparation and Serving Related" sector shows it has its own rules, notably on working hours and career perspectives, and definitely so on female/male worker characteristics very specific to that sector.
- No causality demonstrated.
- No predictability with any model.
